## Project Overview
The [Employee Leave Management System](#code-structure) is a web-based application designed to streamline leave requests, manager approvals, and reporting. It integrates with a mock HR database via CSV import, supports data management, and generates detailed leave reports. This project aligns with Information Management and System Integration and Architecture, showcasing database administration, data integration, workflow automation, and a 3-tier architecture.

## Objectives
- Develop a functional system for employees to submit and managers to approve leave requests.
- Import employee data from a mock HR system via CSV, displaying successes and errors.
- Generate monthly leave summary reports with pending, approved, rejected counts, and total leave days, filterable by year.
- Implement a 3-tier architecture with front-end, logic, and database layers.
- Automate leave request and approval workflows with database-driven notifications.

## Key Features
- **Employee Portal**: Employees submit leave requests with leave type, dates, and reasons.
- **Manager Dashboard**: Managers approve or reject requests, view filtered leave history, and access detailed reports.
- **Reporting Module**: Provides monthly leave summaries (pending, approved, rejected counts, total leave days) with year filtering and PDF download.
- **Data Integration**: Imports employee data via CSV, displaying results for successful imports or errors (e.g., invalid emails, duplicates).
- **Notifications**: Database-driven notifications displayed as toasts or dropdowns with unread counts, triggered for request submissions, approvals, or rejections, with AJAX-based mark-as-read functionality.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Restricts access to `employee` or `manager` roles. Employees access leave submission and history; managers access approvals, reporting, and HR imports.
- **Secure Login**: Enforces CSRF protection, brute force lockout, audit logging, and mandatory first-time password changes.

## System Architecture
The system follows a [3-tier architecture](#key-files-and-their-functionalities):
- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for user interfaces.
- **Logic Layer**: PHP for business logic, including leave processing and approvals.
- **Database Layer**: MySQL/MariaDB for data storage, managed via phpMyAdmin.

### Data Model
- **Entities** (defined in [database.sql](#key-files-and-their-functionalities)):
  - `employees`: Stores employee details (ID, name, department, role).
  - `leave_requests`: Tracks leave requests (request ID, employee ID, dates, status, duration).
  - `leave_types`: Defines leave types (e.g., vacation, sick leave).
  - `leave_balances`: Manages leave balances per leave type.
  - `departments`: Stores department details.
  - `audit_logs`: Records security actions (e.g., logins, password changes).
  - `notifications`: Stores notification messages for users.
  - `remember_tokens`: Manages "Remember Me" login tokens.

### Workflow
1. Employee submits a leave request ([leave_submission.php](#key-files-and-their-functionalities)).
2. Manager reviews and approves/rejects the request ([manage_requests.php](#key-files-and-their-functionalities)).
3. System updates the request status and triggers a notification ([Notifications](#key-features)).

## Tools and Technologies
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) for reports, [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons.
- **Backend**: PHP 8.2.12.
- **Database**: MariaDB 10.4.32 (compatible with MySQL), managed via phpMyAdmin 5.2.1.
- **Integration**: CSV file import for employee data.
- **Version Control**: GitHub for code and documentation.
- **Server**: Apache web server (recommended for PHP deployment).

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-group-repo/leave-management-system.git
   ```
   - Must rename the folder (master) to employee-leave-management-system
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install Apache web server and PHP 8.2.12.
   - Install MariaDB 10.4.32 (or MySQL equivalent) for the database.
   - Install phpMyAdmin 5.2.1 for database management.
3. **Database Setup**:
   - Create a `leave_management` database in MariaDB/MySQL via phpMyAdmin.
   - Import the provided [database.sql](#key-files-and-their-functionalities) (`leave_management.sql`) to set up tables and initial data, including:
     - 10 departments (e.g., Human Resources, Information Technology).
     - 10 leave types (e.g., Vacation, Sick Leave).
     - A manager account for testing (`email: user@example.com`, `password:Test@user1`, `role: manager`, `department: Information Technology`).
4. **Configure Integration**:
   - Place the mock HR CSV file (e.g., `employees.csv`) in [frontend/assets/imports/](#key-files-and-their-functionalities).
5. **Run the Application**:
   - Deploy to Apache and access via `http://localhost/employee-leave-management-system/frontend/public/login.php`.
6. **Access the System**:
   - Log in using the manager account (`user@example.com`) to test features, including CSV imports via [hr_import.php](#key-files-and-their-functionalities).

## Usage
- **Employee**:
  - Log in at [login.php](#key-files-and-their-functionalities). First-time users must change their password.
  - Access the dashboard ([employee_dashboard.php](#key-files-and-their-functionalities)) to submit leave requests, view history, check balances, or manage notifications.
- **Manager**:
  - Log in using the provided manager account (`email: user@example.com`) at [login.php](#key-files-and-their-functionalities). If the password is unknown, reset it via phpMyAdmin or use the known credentials.
  - Access the dashboard ([manager_dashboard.php](#key-files-and-their-functionalities)) to:
    - Approve/reject requests ([manage_requests.php](#key-files-and-their-functionalities)).
    - View leave history with filters for employee name, leave type, status, and dates ([leave_history.php (Manager)](#key-files-and-their-functionalities)).
    - Access monthly leave summaries, filter by year, and download PDFs ([reporting.php](#key-files-and-their-functionalities)).
    - Import employee data via CSV, viewing import results ([hr_import.php](#key-files-and-their-functionalities)).
- **Reports**:
  - Managers use [reporting.php](#key-files-and-their-functionalities) for monthly leave summaries.

## Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Validates form submissions and inputs (e.g., login, password validation).
- **Integration Testing**: Ensures CSV imports work and display accurate results.
- **User Testing**: Verifies manager workflows (approvals, reporting, leave history filtering) and notification usability.
- **Instructor Testing**:
  - Use the manager account (`user@example.com`) to log in and test CSV imports via [hr_import.php](#key-files-and-their-functionalities).
  - Verify reporting and leave history features using [reporting.php](#key-files-and-their-functionalities) and [leave_history.php (Manager)](#key-files-and-their-functionalities).

## Future Enhancements
Based on the current implementation, the following enhancements can improve functionality, usability, and scalability:
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Replace simulated notifications with email and SMS alerts for request submissions, approvals, and rejections, integrating with services like SendGrid or Twilio.
- **Advanced Reporting Analytics**: Add predictive leave trend analysis, cross-department comparisons, and yearly summaries, with interactive dashboards using tools like D3.js.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Implement a PWA to leverage the responsive design, enabling offline access, push notifications, and a native-like experience on mobile devices without separate app development.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Implement internationalization (i18n) for accessibility, supporting languages like Filipino and Spanish.
- **Enhanced Security**: Add two-factor authentication (2FA) via email or authenticator apps, and encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords) with stronger algorithms.
- **API Integration**: Expose a RESTful API for third-party HR systems to sync employee data or leave requests, secured with OAuth 2.0.
- **Audit Trail Dashboard**: Create a manager-accessible dashboard to view and export audit logs (`audit_logs` table) for compliance and monitoring.
- **Automated Leave Balance Adjustments**: Implement scheduled tasks to update leave balances based on hire dates, policies, or accruals, reducing manual updates via phpMyAdmin.
- **User Profile Management**: Allow users to update profiles (e.g., contact info, profile pictures) and manage notification preferences.
- **Offline CSV Import Support**: Enable queued imports for offline processing, handling large datasets without timeouts.
- **Database Optimization**: Add indexes to `leave_requests` and `notifications` tables, and implement caching (e.g., Redis) for frequent queries to improve performance.
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 compliance with screen reader support and keyboard navigation for all UI components.
- **Bulk Request Management**: Allow managers to approve/reject multiple leave requests simultaneously via the manager dashboard.
- **Custom Leave Policies**: Support configurable leave policies per department (e.g., different accrual rates, approval workflows).
- **Employee Self-Service Portal**: Add features for employees to view payslips, tax forms, or HR policies, integrating with the mock HR system.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy to a cloud platform like AWS or Azure for scalability, with load balancing and auto-scaling for high traffic.

## Notes
- Follow modular coding, commenting, and version control practices.
- Ensure repository organization with clear folders.
- Maintain data integrity and usability.
- **Security**: CSRF protection, brute force lockout, audit logging, and mandatory password changes enhance security ([LoginController.php](#key-files-and-their-functionalities)).
- **Notifications**: Stored in `notifications` table, fetched via controllers, displayed as toasts/dropdowns with unread badges, and updated via AJAX ([ManagerDashboardController.php](#key-files-and-their-functionalities)).
- **RBAC**: Uses `employee` and `manager` roles, enforced by [AuthMiddleware.php](#key-files-and-their-functionalities) and [Session.php](#key-files-and-their-functionalities). Managers access exclusive features; employees are restricted.
- Database operations use phpMyAdmin, with [Auth.php](#key-files-and-their-functionalities) for authentication and [LeaveModel.php](#key-files-and-their-functionalities) for leave queries.
- The manager account (`user@example.com`) is included in the database for testing, ensuring your instructor can log in and import employees via CSV without creating a new account.
